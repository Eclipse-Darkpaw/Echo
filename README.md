# Echo v0.1.2
Echo is a bot I've made for my discord servers I moderate

If you want a discord bot, please do not use this. Use a better bot, bc this is just to show I can actually do this

## Features
### General use
`test` - outputs a message saying the bot is online

### Moderation
`warn <member>`

`kick <member>` - kicks the user tagged from the server
