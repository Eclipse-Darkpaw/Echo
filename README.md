# Echo v1.2.1
Echo is a bot I've made for my discord servers I moderate. Most values are hard coded in right now.

## Features
### General use
`help` - displays the help for the functions

`verify` - begins the verification process for a user 

`modmail` - sends a message to the server moderators

### Moderation
`warn <member>` - assigns a warn to the tagged user

`suspend <member>` - suspends the user from the server.

`kick <member>` - kicks the user tagged from the server

`ban <member>` - bans the user tagged from the server

`quit` - quits the program
